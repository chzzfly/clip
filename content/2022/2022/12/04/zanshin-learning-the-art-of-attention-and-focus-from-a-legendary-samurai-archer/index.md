> 残心（日语：残心，平假名：ざんしん），是日本的武道以及艺术文化中所使用的词汇，日语汉字也可写作残身或残芯（发音相同）。字面上直接翻译的意思是残留的警戒心。若更深入的体会则是（武术或艺术的）表演结束后，虽然力气放松或动作已经完成，人依然保持警戒与注意力的状态。再者，（武术或艺术的）表演完成的同时，并非就此结束，而是仍然保有余韵，是与日本的美学或禅相关的一种概念。 

In the 1920s, a German professor named Eugen Herrigel moved to Japan. He came to teach philosophy at a university a few hours northeast of Tokyo, in a city called Sendai.

20 年代，一位名叫 Eugen Herrigel 的德国教授移居日本。 他来教书 哲学 在距东京东北几个小时车程的仙台市的一所大学里。

To deepen his understanding of Japanese culture, Herrigel began training in Kyudo, the Japanese martial art of archery. He was taught by a legendary archer named Awa Kenzo. Kenzo was convinced that beginners should master the fundamentals of archery before attempting to shoot at a real target, and he took this method to the extreme. For the first four years of his training, Herrigel was only allowed to shoot at a roll of straw just seven feet away.

为了加深对日本文化的了解，Herrigel 开始学习日本射箭武术 Kyudo。 他的老师是一位名叫阿波健三的传奇弓箭手。 Kenzo 坚信初学者应该掌握 基础知识 在尝试射向真正的目标之前，他已经学会了射箭，他将这种方法发挥到了极致。 在训练的头四年里，赫里格尔只被允许在七英尺外的一卷稻草上射击。

When Herrigel complained of the incredibly slow pace, his teacher replied “The way to the goal is not to be measured! Of what importance are weeks, months, years?”

当 Herrigel 抱怨步伐太慢时，他的老师回答说：“通往目标的道路是无法衡量的！ 周、月、年有多重要？”

When he was finally permitted to shoot at more distant targets, Herrigel’s performance was dismal. The arrows flew off course and he became more discouraged with each wayward shot. During a particularly humbling session, Herrigel stated that his problem must be poor aim.

当他终于 允许 为了射击更远的目标，赫里格尔的表现令人沮丧。 箭偏离了轨道，每一次任性的射箭，他都变得更加沮丧。 在一次特别谦逊的会议上，赫里格尔表示他的问题一定是瞄准不佳。

Kenzo, however, looked at his student and replied that it was not whether one aimed, but how one approached the task that determined the outcome. Frustrated with this reply, Herrigel blurted out, “Then you ought to be able to hit it blindfolded.”

然而，Kenzo 看着他的学生回答说，决定结果的不是一个人是否有目标，而是一个人如何完成任务。 赫里格尔对这个回答感到沮丧，脱口而出：“那你应该可以蒙着眼睛打它。”

Kenzo paused for a moment and then said, “Come to see me this evening.”

Kenzo 顿了顿，然后说：“今晚来看我。”

## Archery in the Dark

## 黑暗中的射箭

After night had fallen, the two men returned to the courtyard where the practice hall was located. Kenzo walked to his usual shooting location, now with the target hidden in the dark. The archery master proceeded through his normal routine, settled into his firing stance, drew the bow string tight, and released the first arrow into the darkness.

夜幕降临后，两人回到了修炼殿所在的小院。 Kenzo 走到他通常的射击位置，现在目标隐藏在黑暗中。 箭术大师一如既往地摆好射势，拉紧弓弦，第一支箭射向了黑暗。

Recalling the event later, Herrigel wrote, “I knew from the sound that it had hit the target.”

Herrigel 后来回忆起这件事时写道：“我从声音中知道它击中了目标。”

Immediately, Kenzo drew a second arrow and again fired into the night.

随即，贤三抽出第二支箭，再次射向夜色。

Herrigel jumped up and ran across the courtyard to inspect the target. In his book, [Zen in the Art of Archery](https://jamesclear.com/book/zen-in-the-art-of-archery "Eugen Herrigel 射箭艺术中的禅宗"), he wrote, “When I switched on the light over the target stand, I discovered to my amazement that the first arrow was lodged full in the middle of the black, while the second arrow had splintered the butt of the first and ploughed through the shaft before embedding itself beside it.”

赫里格尔跳了起来，跑过院子检查目标。 在他的书 [《射箭艺术中的禅》中](https://jamesclear.com/book/zen-in-the-art-of-archery "  Eugen Herrigel 的射箭艺术中的禅宗") ，他写道：“当我打开靶架上的灯时，我惊讶地发现第一支箭完全射在了黑色的中间，而第二支箭已经打碎了第一个的枪托并穿过了竖井，然后将自己嵌入了它旁边。”

Kenzo had hit a double bullseye without being able to see the target.

Kenzo 在看不到目标的情况下击中了双靶心。

## Everything Is Aiming

## 一切都在瞄准

Great archery masters often teach that “everything is aiming.” Where you place your feet, how you hold the bow, the way you breathe during the release of the arrow—it all determines the end result.

伟大的射箭大师经常教导“一切都是瞄准”。 你的脚放在哪里，你如何握弓，你在射箭时的呼吸方式——这一切都决定了最终的结果。

In the case of Awa Kenzo, the master archer was so mindful of the process that led to an accurate shot that he was able to replicate the exact series of internal movements even without seeing the external target. This complete awareness of the body and mind in relation to the goal is known as _zanshin_.

在 Awa Kenzo 的案例中，弓箭大师非常注意导致 准确的 射击他能够 复制 即使没有看到外部目标，也能进行一系列准确的内部运动。 这种与目标相关的身心的完整意识被称为 _残心_ 。

_Zanshin_ is a word used commonly throughout Japanese martial arts to refer to a state of relaxed alertness. Literally translated, _zanshin_ means “the mind with no remainder.” In other words, the mind completely focused on action and fixated on the task at hand. _Zanshin_ is being constantly aware of your body, mind, and surroundings without stressing yourself. It is an effortless vigilance.

_Zanshin_ 是日本武术中常用的一个词，指的是一种放松的警觉状态。 的字面意思 _zanshin_ 是“无余心”。 换句话说，头脑完全专注于行动并专注于手头的任务。 _残心_ 正在 不断地 在不给自己压力的情况下，了解您的身体、思想和周围环境。 这是一种毫不费力的警惕。

In practice, though, _zanshin_ has an even deeper meaning. _Zanshin_ is choosing to live your life intentionally and acting with purpose rather than mindlessly falling victim to whatever comes your way.

但实际上， _残心_ 还有更深的含义。 _Zanshin_ 正在选择有意识地过你的生活并有目的地行动，而不是盲目地成为你遇到的任何事情的受害者。

## The Enemy of Improvement

## 改进的敌人

There is a famous Japanese proverb that says, “After winning the battle, tighten your helmet.”[](https://jamesclear.com/zanshin#)

日本有一句著名的谚语，“打胜仗后，拧紧头盔”。[](https://jamesclear.com/zanshin#)

In other words, the battle does not end when you win. The battle only ends when you get lazy, when you lose your sense of commitment, and when you stop paying attention. This is _zanshin_ as well: the act of living with alertness regardless of whether the goal has already been achieved.

换句话说，战斗并没有在您获胜时结束。 只有当你变得懒惰，当你失去责任感，当你不再专心时，战斗才会结束。 这也是 _残心_ ：无论目标是否已经实现，都要保持警觉地生活。

We can carry this philosophy into many areas of life.

我们可以携带这个 哲学 进入生活的许多领域。

-   **Writing:** The battle does not end when you publish a book. It ends when you consider yourself a finished product, when you lose the vigilance needed to continue improving your craft.
-   **写作：** 当你出版一本书时，战斗并没有结束。 当您认为自己是成品时，当您失去继续改进工艺所需的警惕时，它就会结束。
-   **Fitness:** The battle does not end when you hit a PR. It ends when you lose concentration and skip workouts or when you lose perspective and overtrain.
-   **健身：** 当您获得 PR 时，战斗并没有结束。 当您注意力不集中并跳过锻炼时，或者当您失去洞察力并过度训练时，它就会结束。
-   **Entrepreneurship:** The battle does not end when you make a big sale. It ends when you get cocky and complacent.
-   **企业家精神：** 当你做大生意时，战斗并没有结束。 当你变得自大和自满时，它就结束了。

The enemy of improvement is neither failure nor success. The enemy of improvement is boredom, fatigue, and lack of concentration. The enemy of improvement is a lack of commitment to the process because the process is everything.

改进的敌人既不是失败也不是成功。 进步的敌人是无聊、疲劳和注意力不集中。 改进的敌人是缺乏对过程的承诺，因为过程就是一切。

## The Art of Zanshin in Everday Life

## 日常生活中的残心艺术

_“One should approach all activities and situations with the same sincerity, the same intensity, and the same awareness that one has with bow and arrow in hand.”_

_“一个人应该以同样的诚意、同样的热情和同样的意识对待所有的活动和情况，就像一个人手持弓箭一样。”_

—Kenneth Kushner, [One Arrow, One Life](https://jamesclear.com/book/one-arrow-one-life "肯尼斯·库什纳 (Kenneth Kushner")

——肯尼斯·库什纳， [一只箭，一条生命](https://jamesclear.com/book/one-arrow-one-life " ) 的《一箭一生》 肯尼斯·库什纳 (Kenneth Kushner) 的《一箭一生》")

We live in a world obsessed with results. Like Herrigel, we have a tendency to put so much emphasis on whether or not the arrow hits the target. If, however, we put that intensity and focus and sincerity into the process—where we place our feet, how we hold the bow, how we breathe during the release of the arrow—then hitting the bullseye is simply a side effect.

我们生活在一个痴迷于结果的世界里。 像 Herrigel 一样，我们倾向于投入太多 强调 关于箭头是否击中目标。 然而，如果我们将这种强度、专注和真诚投入到这个过程中——我们把脚放在哪里，我们如何握弓，我们在放箭时如何呼吸——那么 打 靶心只是一个副作用。

The point is not to worry about hitting the target. The point is to [fall in love with the boredom of doing the work](https://jamesclear.com/stay-focused "无聊时如何保持专注。") and embrace each piece of the process. The point is to take that moment of _zanshin_, that moment of complete awareness and focus, and carry it with you everywhere in life.

重点是不用担心 打 目标。 重点是 [爱上工作的无聊，](https://jamesclear.com/stay-focused "无聊时如何保持专注。") 拥抱过程中的每一部分。 关键是要抓住那一刻的 _残心_ ，那一刻的全然觉知和专注，并将它带到生活的任何地方。

It is not the target that matters. It is not the finish line that matters. It is the way we approach the goal that matters. Everything is aiming. _Zanshin_.

重要的不是目标。 重要的不是终点线。 重要的是我们实现目标的方式。 一切都在瞄准。 _残心_ 。
