The economist J.K. Galbraith once wrote, “Faced with a choice between changing one’s mind and proving there is no need to do so, almost everyone gets busy with the proof.”

经济学家 JK 加尔布雷思 (JK Galbraith) 曾写道：“面对改变主意和证明没有必要这样做的选择，几乎每个人都忙于证明。”

Leo Tolstoy was even bolder: “The most difficult subjects can be explained to the most slow-witted man if he has not formed any idea of them already; but the simplest thing cannot be made clear to the most intelligent man if he is firmly persuaded that he knows already, without a shadow of doubt, what is laid before him.”

列夫·托尔斯泰甚至更大胆：“最困难的主题可以解释给最迟钝的人，如果他没有 形成 已经对它们有任何想法； 但是，如果最聪明的人坚信他已经毫无疑问地知道摆在他面前的是什么，那么即使是最聪明的人也无法弄清楚最简单的事情。”

What's going on here? Why don't facts change our minds? And why would someone continue to believe a false or inaccurate idea anyway? How do such behaviors serve us?  

这里发生了什么？ 为什么事实没有改变我们的想法？ 为什么有人会继续相信错误或不准确的想法呢？ 这些行为如何为我们服务？  

## The Logic of False Beliefs

## 错误信念的逻辑

Humans need a reasonably accurate view of the world in order to survive. If your model of reality is wildly different from the actual world, then you struggle to take effective actions each day.[](https://jamesclear.com/why-facts-dont-change-minds#)

人类需要一个合理的 准确的 生存的世界观。 如果你的现实模型与现实世界截然不同，那么你每天都很难采取有效的行动。[](https://jamesclear.com/why-facts-dont-change-minds#)

However, truth and accuracy are not the only things that matter to the human mind. Humans also seem to have a deep desire to belong.

然而，真实和准确并不是人类头脑中唯一重要的事情。 人类似乎也有强烈的归属感。

In [Atomic Habits](http://atomichabits.com/), I wrote, “Humans are herd animals. We want to fit in, to bond with others, and to earn the respect and approval of our peers. Such inclinations are essential to our survival. For most of our evolutionary history, our ancestors lived in tribes. Becoming separated from the tribe—or worse, being cast out—was a death sentence.”

在 [原子习惯中](http://atomichabits.com/) ，我写道，“人类是群居动物。 我们想要适应，为了 纽带 与他人相处，并赢得同行的尊重和认可。 这种倾向对我们的生存至关重要。 在我们进化史的大部分时间里，我们的祖先生活在部落中。 变得 分离 来自部落——或者更糟，被驱逐——就是死刑。”

Understanding the truth of a situation is important, but so is remaining part of a tribe. While these two desires often work well together, they occasionally come into conflict.

了解情况的真相很重要，但保持部落的一部分也很重要。 虽然这两种愿望通常可以很好地协同工作，但它们偶尔会发生冲突。

In many circumstances, social connection is actually more helpful to your daily life than understanding the truth of a particular fact or idea. The Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker put it this way, “People are embraced or condemned according to their beliefs, so one function of the mind may be to hold beliefs that bring the belief-holder the greatest number of allies, protectors, or disciples, rather than beliefs that are most likely to be true.”[](https://jamesclear.com/why-facts-dont-change-minds#)

在许多情况下，社交关系实际上比了解特定事实或想法的真相对您的日常生活更有帮助。 哈佛大学心理学家史蒂文·平克这样说：“人们被拥抱或 谴责 根据他们的信仰，心智的一个功能可能是持有能为信仰者带来最多盟友、保护者或门徒的信仰，而不是最有可能为真的信仰。”[](https://jamesclear.com/why-facts-dont-change-minds#)

We don't always believe things because they are correct. Sometimes we believe things because they make us look good to the people we care about.

我们并不总是因为事情是正确的就相信事情。 有时我们相信某些事情是因为它们让我们在我们关心的人面前看起来很好。

I thought Kevin Simler put it well when he wrote, “If a brain anticipates that it will be rewarded for adopting a particular belief, it's perfectly happy to do so, and doesn't much care where the reward comes from — whether it's pragmatic (better outcomes resulting from better decisions), social (better treatment from one's peers), or some mix of the two.”[](https://jamesclear.com/why-facts-dont-change-minds#)

我认为凯文·西姆勒 (Kevin Simler) 写得很好，“如果大脑预期它会因 采用 一个特定的信念，它非常乐意这样做，并且不太关心奖励的来源——无论是务实的（更好的决策带来更好的结果）、社会的（来自同龄人的更好的待遇），还是两者的某种结合”[](https://jamesclear.com/why-facts-dont-change-minds#)

False beliefs can be useful in a social sense even if they are not useful in a factual sense. For lack of a better phrase, we might call this approach “factually false, but socially accurate .” [](https://jamesclear.com/why-facts-dont-change-minds#)When we have to choose between the two, people often select friends and family over facts.

错误的信念在社会意义上可能是有用的，即使它们在事实意义上没有用。 由于缺乏更好的用语，我们可以称这种方法为“事实上是错误的，但在社会上 准确的 .” [](https://jamesclear.com/why-facts-dont-change-minds#)当我们必须在两者之间做出选择时，人们往往会选择朋友和家人而不是事实。

This insight not only explains why we might hold our tongue at a dinner party or look the other way when our parents say something offensive, but also reveals a better way to change the minds of others.

这种洞察力不仅解释了为什么我们可能会在晚宴上闭口不谈或当我们的父母说出令人不快的事情时另眼相看，而且还揭示了改变他人想法的更好方法。

## Facts Don't Change Our Minds. Friendship Does.

## 事实不会改变我们的想法。 友谊确实如此。

Convincing someone to change their mind is really the process of convincing them to change their tribe. If they abandon their beliefs, they run the risk of losing social ties. You can’t expect someone to change their mind if you take away their community too. You have to give them somewhere to go. Nobody wants their worldview torn apart if loneliness is the outcome.

说服某人改变主意实际上是说服他们改变部落的过程。 如果他们放弃自己的信仰，就会面临失去社会联系的风险。 你不能 预计 如果您也带走了他们的社区，有人会改变主意。 你必须给他们一个地方去。 如果孤独是结果，没有人希望他们的世界观被撕裂。

The way to change people’s minds is to become friends with them, to integrate them into your tribe, to bring them into your circle. Now, they can change their beliefs without the risk of being abandoned socially.

改变人心的方法就是和他们成为朋友，把他们融入你的部落，把他们带进你的圈子。 现在，他们可以改变自己的信仰，而不必担心被社会遗弃。

The British philosopher Alain de Botton suggests that we simply share meals with those who disagree with us:

英国哲学家阿兰·德波顿建议我们只是与那些不同意我们的人一起吃饭：

“Sitting down at a table with a group of strangers has the incomparable and odd benefit of making it a little more difficult to hate them with impunity. Prejudice and ethnic strife feed off abstraction. However, the proximity required by a meal – something about handing dishes around, unfurling napkins at the same moment, even asking a stranger to pass the salt – disrupts our ability to cling to the belief that the outsiders who wear unusual clothes and speak in distinctive accents deserve to be sent home or assaulted. For all the large-scale political solutions which have been proposed to salve ethnic conflict, there are few more effective ways to promote tolerance between suspicious neighbours than to force them to eat supper together.”[](https://jamesclear.com/why-facts-dont-change-minds#)

“和一群陌生人坐在一张桌子旁有一个无与伦比的奇怪好处，那就是让人更难恨他们而不受惩罚。 偏见和种族冲突助长了抽象。 然而，用餐所需要的亲近——比如在同一时刻递菜，同时展开餐巾，甚至要求陌生人递盐——破坏了我们坚持这样一种信念的能力，即穿着不同寻常的衣服和说话的外人与众不同 口音 应该被送回家或受到殴打。 对于所有大规模的政治解决方案 建议的 要化解种族冲突，没有什么比强迫他们一起吃晚饭更有效地促进可疑邻居之间的容忍了。”[](https://jamesclear.com/why-facts-dont-change-minds#)

Perhaps it is not _difference_, but _distance_ that breeds tribalism and hostility. As proximity increases, so does understanding. I am reminded of Abraham Lincoln's quote, “I don't like that man. I must get to know him better.”

也许 _的不是差异_ ，而是 _距离_ 滋生部落主义和敌意 。 随着距离的增加，理解也会增加。 我想起了亚伯拉罕林肯的名言：“我不喜欢那个人。 我必须更好地了解他。”

Facts don't change our minds. Friendship does.

事实不会改变我们的想法。 友谊呢。

## The Spectrum of Beliefs

## 信仰的范围

Years ago, Ben Casnocha mentioned an idea to me that I haven't been able to shake: The people who are most likely to change our minds are the ones we agree with on 98 percent of topics.

多年前，Ben Casnocha 向我提到了一个我一直无法动摇的想法：最有可能改变我们想法的人是我们在 98% 的话题上都同意的人。

If someone you know, like, and trust believes a radical idea, you are more likely to give it merit, weight, or consideration. You already agree with them in most areas of life. Maybe you should change your mind on this one too. But if someone wildly different than you proposes the same radical idea, well, it's easy to dismiss them as a crackpot.

如果你认识、喜欢和信任的人相信一个激进的想法，你就更有可能给予它价值、权重或考虑。 您已经在生活的大部分领域同意他们的观点。 也许你也应该改变主意。 但如果有人与你截然不同 建议 同样激进的想法，好吧，很容易将他们视为疯子。

One way to visualize this distinction is by mapping beliefs on a spectrum. If you divide this spectrum into 10 units and you find yourself at Position 7, then there is little sense in trying to convince someone at Position 1. The gap is too wide. When you're at Position 7, your time is better spent connecting with people who are at Positions 6 and 8, gradually pulling them in your direction.

将这种区别形象化的一种方法是将信念映射到频谱上。 如果你把这个频谱分成 10 个单位，你发现自己在位置 7，那么试图说服位置 1 的人就没有什么意义了。差距太大了。 当你处于第 7 位时，你的时间最好花在与第 6 位和第 8 位的人联系上， 逐步地 将它们拉向您的方向。

The most heated arguments often occur between people on opposite ends of the spectrum, but the most frequent learning occurs from people who are nearby. The closer you are to someone, the more likely it becomes that the one or two beliefs you don't share will bleed over into your own mind and shape your thinking. The further away an idea is from your current position, the more likely you are to reject it outright.

最热烈的 争论 通常发生在频谱两端的人之间，但最常见的学习发生在附近的人身上。 你与某人越亲近，你不认同的一两个信念就越有可能渗入你自己的思想并塑造你的思维。 一个想法离你目前的立场越远，你就越有可能完全拒绝它。

When it comes to changing people's minds, it is very difficult to jump from one side to another. You can't jump down the spectrum. You have to slide down it.

谈到改变人们的想法，很难从一边跳到另一边。 你不能跳下频谱。 你必须滑下它。

Any idea that is sufficiently different from your current worldview will feel threatening. And the best place to ponder a threatening idea is in a non-threatening environment. As a result, books are often a better vehicle for transforming beliefs than conversations or debates.

任何与你当前的世界观完全不同的想法都会让人感到威胁。 思考威胁性想法的最佳场所是在非威胁性环境中。 因此，书往往是更好的 车辆 比对话或辩论更能改变信念。

In conversation, people have to carefully consider their status and appearance. They want to save face and avoid looking stupid. When confronted with an uncomfortable set of facts, the tendency is often to double down on their current position rather than publicly admit to being wrong.

在谈话中，人们必须仔细考虑他们的地位和外表。 他们想挽回面子 避免 看起来很傻。 当面对一组令人不安的事实时，人们往往倾向于加倍坚持他们目前的立场，而不是公开承认错误。

Books resolve this tension. With a book, the conversation takes place inside someone's head and without the risk of being judged by others. It's easier to be open-minded when you aren't feeling defensive.

书籍解决了这种紧张局势。 有了书，对话就发生在某人的脑海中，而没有被他人评判的风险。 当您不感到防御时，更容易思想开放。

Arguments are like a full frontal attack on a person's identity. Reading a book is like slipping the seed of an idea into a person's brain and letting it grow on their own terms . There's enough wrestling going on in someone's head when they are overcoming a pre-existing belief. They don't need to wrestle with you too.

参数 就像是对一个人身份的全面正面攻击。 读一本书就像把一个想法的种子植入一个人的大脑，让它自己成长 条款 . 当一个人克服已有的信念时，他们的脑子里就会有足够的摔跤。 他们也不需要和你较量。

## Why False Ideas Persist

## 为什么错误的想法 坚持

There is another reason bad ideas continue to live on, which is that people continue to talk about them.

坏主意继续存在的另一个原因是人们继续谈论它们。

Silence is death for any idea. An idea that is never spoken or written down dies with the person who conceived it. Ideas can only be remembered when they are repeated. They can only be _believed_ when they are repeated.

沉默是任何想法的死亡。 一个从未被说出或写下来的想法会随着构思它的人而消亡。 想法只有在重复时才能被记住。 才会被 _相信。_ 只有当它们被重复时，它们

I have already pointed out that people repeat ideas to signal they are part of the same social group. But here's a crucial point most people miss:

我已经指出，人们重复想法是为了表明他们属于同一社会群体。 但这里有一个关键点，大多数人都忽略了：

People also repeat bad ideas when they complain about them. Before you can criticize an idea, you have to reference that idea. You end up repeating the ideas you’re hoping people will forget—but, of course, people can’t forget them because you keep talking about them. The more you repeat a bad idea, the more likely people are to believe it.[](https://jamesclear.com/why-facts-dont-change-minds#)

人们在抱怨坏主意时也会重复这些坏主意。 在你批评一个想法之前，你必须参考那个想法。 你最终会重复你希望人们忘记的想法——但是，当然，人们不会忘记它们，因为你一直在谈论它们。 你重复一个坏主意的次数越多，人们就越有可能相信它。[](https://jamesclear.com/why-facts-dont-change-minds#)

Let's call this phenomenon **Clear's Law of Recurrence:** The number of people who believe an idea is directly proportional to the number of times it has been repeated during the last year—even if the idea is false.[](https://jamesclear.com/why-facts-dont-change-minds#)

让我们称这种现象 **为克利尔的复发定律：** 相信一个想法的人数与它在过去一年中被重复的次数成正比——即使这个想法是错误的。[](https://jamesclear.com/why-facts-dont-change-minds#)

Each time you attack a bad idea, you are feeding the very monster you are trying to destroy. As one Twitter employee wrote, “Every time you retweet or quote tweet someone you’re angry with, it _helps_ them. It disseminates their BS. Hell for the ideas you deplore is silence. Have the discipline to give it to them.”[](https://jamesclear.com/why-facts-dont-change-minds#)

每次你攻击一个坏主意，你就是在喂养你试图摧毁的怪物。 正如一位 Twitter 员工所写，“每次你转推或引用你生气的人的推文，都会 _帮助_ 他们。 它传播他们的学士学位。 你痛惜的想法地狱是沉默。 有纪律给他们。”[](https://jamesclear.com/why-facts-dont-change-minds#)

Your time is better spent championing good ideas than tearing down bad ones. Don't waste time explaining why bad ideas are bad. You are simply fanning the flame of ignorance and stupidity.

你的时间最好花在倡导好的想法上，而不是推翻坏的想法上。 不要浪费时间解释为什么坏主意是坏的。 你只是在煽动无知和愚蠢的火焰。

The best thing that can happen to a bad idea is that it is forgotten. The best thing that can happen to a good idea is that it is shared. It makes me think of Tyler Cowen's quote, “Spend as little time as possible talking about how other people are wrong.”

一个坏主意可能发生的最好的事情就是它被遗忘了。 一个好主意可能发生的最好的事情就是它被分享。 这让我想起了泰勒·考恩 (Tyler Cowen) 的名言：“花尽可能少的时间谈论别人的错误。”

Feed the good ideas and let bad ideas die of starvation.

喂养好的想法，让坏的想法饿死。

## The Intellectual Soldier

## 智力战士

I know what you might be thinking. “James, are you serious right now? I'm just supposed to let these idiots _get away_ with this?”

我知道你可能在想什么。 “詹姆斯，你现在是认真的吗？ 我只是应该让这些白痴逍遥法外 _吗_ ？”

Let me be clear. I'm not saying it's _never_ useful to point out an error or criticize a bad idea. But you have to ask yourself, “What is the goal?”

让我说清楚。 我并不是说 _永远没有_ 指出错误或批评坏主意 用。 但你必须问自己，“目标是什么？”

Why do you want to criticize bad ideas in the first place? Presumably, you want to criticize bad ideas because you think the world would be better off if fewer people believed them. In other words, you think the world would improve if people changed their minds on a few important topics.

你为什么要首先批评坏主意？ 大概，您想批评坏主意，因为您认为如果更少的人相信它们，世界会变得更好。 换句话说，你认为如果人们在一些重要话题上改变主意，世界就会变得更好。

If the goal is to actually change minds, then I don't believe criticizing the other side is the best approach.

如果目标是真正改变想法，那么我不认为批评对方是最好的方法。

Most people argue to win, not to learn. As Julia Galef so aptly puts it: people often act like soldiers rather than scouts. Soldiers are on the intellectual attack, looking to defeat the people who differ from them. Victory is the operative emotion. Scouts, meanwhile , are like intellectual explorers, slowly trying to map the terrain with others. Curiosity is the driving force.[](https://jamesclear.com/why-facts-dont-change-minds#)

大多数人争辩是为了赢，而不是为了学习。 正如 Julia Galef 所说的那样：人们通常表现得像士兵而不是侦察兵。 士兵们正在进行智力攻击，希望击败与他们不同的人。 胜利是有效的情绪。 童子军， 同时 ，就像智力探险家，慢慢地尝试与他人一起绘制地形图。 好奇心 是驱动力。[](https://jamesclear.com/why-facts-dont-change-minds#)

If you want people to adopt your beliefs, you need to act more like a scout and less like a soldier. At the center of this approach is a question Tiago Forte poses beautifully, “Are you willing to not win in order to keep the conversation going?”

如果你想让人们 采纳 你的信念，你需要表现得更像一个侦察员，而不是一个士兵。 这种方法的核心是 Tiago Forte 漂亮地提出的一个问题，“为了让对话继续下去，你愿意不赢吗？”

## Be Kind First, Be Right Later

## 先善良，后正确

The brilliant Japanese writer Haruki Murakami once wrote, “Always remember that to argue, and win, is to break down the reality of the person you are arguing against. It is painful to lose your reality, so be kind, even if you are right.”[](https://jamesclear.com/why-facts-dont-change-minds#)

才华横溢的日本作家村上春树曾写道：“永远记住，争论并赢得胜利，就是打破你所争论的人的现实。 失去现实是痛苦的，所以要善良，即使你是对的。”[](https://jamesclear.com/why-facts-dont-change-minds#)

When we are in the moment, we can easily forget that the goal is to connect with the other side, collaborate with them, befriend them, and integrate them into our tribe. We are so caught up in winning that we forget about connecting. It's easy to spend your energy labeling people rather than working with them.

当我们处于当下时，我们很容易忘记我们的目标是与对方建立联系，与他们合作，与他们交朋友，并将他们融入我们的部落。 我们如此专注于胜利，以至于忘记了联系。 很容易将精力花在给人们贴标签上，而不是与他们一起工作。

The word “kind” originated from the word “kin.” When you are kind to someone it means you are treating them like family. This, I think, is a good method for actually changing someone's mind. Develop a friendship. Share a meal. Gift a book.

“亲”字源于“亲”字。 当您对某人友善时，这意味着您像对待家人一样对待他们。 我认为，这是真正改变某人想法的好方法。 发展友谊。 分享一顿饭。 赠送一本书。

Be kind first, be right later.[](https://jamesclear.com/why-facts-dont-change-minds#)

先善良，后正确。[](https://jamesclear.com/why-facts-dont-change-minds#)
