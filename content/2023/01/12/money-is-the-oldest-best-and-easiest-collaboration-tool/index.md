Read an interesting old email.  读到一封有趣的旧邮件。

> It is our DUTY to ask for money so that commercial customers understand the value and feel comfortable that we are driven by motives that they understand. They want someone to blame when it is not working. And we in turn are then honor bound to use that money to safeguard the investment that our customers are making. Putting all the money in your pocket without reinvesting (most) of it is dishonest, but allowing a technology to wither by not ensuring that it has a solid foundation is every bit as irresponsible (IMHO !!!).

> 我们有责任向客户要钱，这样商业客户就能理解我们的价值，并对我们的动机感到放心，他们也能理解。他们希望在设备不工作的时候有人可以指责。反过来，我们也有义务用这些钱来保护我们客户的投资。把所有的钱放在你的口袋里而不进行再投资（大部分）是不诚实的，但如果不确保一项技术有一个坚实的基础而让它枯萎，那也是不负责任的（我认为！）。

> It should be very inexpensive to get started - but people HAVE to contribute when they get real value from using the tool.
>
> 它应该是非常便宜的开始 - 但当人们从使用该工具获得真正的价值时，他们必须做出贡献。

We are spoiled by too many free heritage in the software that we ignore this common sense.  
我们被软件中太多的免费遗产宠坏了，以至于忽略了这个常识。

When you start charging, it will be easier for you to start a longer-term collaboration with others. When you find that the charges are insufficient , you will also get feedback to go in a truly valuable direction.

当你开始收费时，你会更容易与他人开始更长期的合作。当你发现收费是不够的 ，你也会得到反馈，从而走向真正有价值的方向。

In my understanding, smart people and geeks often have a greater sense of morality and are unwilling to charge fees. But this sense of morality will become a twisted form to hinder people's normal development.

在我的理解中，聪明人和怪人往往有更多的道德感，不愿意收费。但这种道德感会成为一种扭曲的形式，阻碍人们的正常发展。

This is very sad. The best people are trapped in the trap of providing services free of charge, while another group of people are getting very precious cash flow with very disadvantaged products and services. As a result, social resources are not allocated to those in need.

这是很可悲的。最优秀的人陷入了免费提供服务的陷阱，而另一群人却以非常不利的产品和服务获得非常宝贵的现金流。结果，社会资源没有被分配给需要的人。

If you want to work better with this society and charge you for your work, no matter how much it is, even a little cost, this mechanism will make it easier for you to collaborate with others.

如果你想和这个社会更好地合作，向你的工作收费，不管是多少钱，哪怕是一点成本，这个机制会让你更容易和别人合作。

Money is a universal collaborative interface. If you refuse to use this, you are doing things in a more expensive way, and it is not long-term.

钱是一个通用的合作界面。如果你拒绝使用这个，你就是在用更昂贵的方式做事，而且不是长期的。

On the other point, I remember saying in sivers that many times, providing free products also deprives people of the right to pay for you. You should allow people who really like you to express their appreciation for you.

关于另一点，我记得在 Sivers 说过，很多时候，提供免费产品也剥夺了人们为你付费的权利。你应该让那些真正喜欢你的人对你表示感谢。

When you are struggling, you can go back to this starting point and try the oldest and most effective way of human collaboration.

当你在挣扎时，你可以回到这个起点，尝试人类最古老、最有效的合作方式。
