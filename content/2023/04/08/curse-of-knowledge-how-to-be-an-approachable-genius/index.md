It took “great talent or skill to conceal one’s talent or skill,” the French moralist François VI, Duc de La Rochefoucauld once noted. As soon as we’ve reached a certain level of mastery , say in playing chess, it’s hard to act as if we knew little about the game of kings. That’s partly because it’s difficult to imagine what it was like when we were still steeped in ignorance. Even if that was just five minutes ago. Known as the Curse of Knowledge, this phenomenon speaks to the tragic burden mastery can be.  

法国道德家弗朗索瓦六世 (François VI, Duc de La Rochefoucauld) 曾指出，“要隐藏一个人的才能或技能，需要高超的才能或技巧”。一旦我们达到了一定的精通水平，比如下国际象棋，就很难表现得好像我们对国王游戏知之甚少。这在一定程度上是因为很难想象当我们还沉浸在无知中时会是什么样子。即使那只是五分钟前。这种现象被称为知识的诅咒，说明了掌握知识可能带来的悲剧性负担。

## What Is the Curse of Knowledge?  

什么是知识的诅咒？

The Curse of Knowledge is a cognitive bias that arises from having a greater understanding of a particular topic. It’s a phenomenon whereby those who possess more knowledge about a given subject find it difficult to relate to those with less familiarity. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunication, and even conflict.  

知识的诅咒是一种认知偏差，是由于对特定主题有更深入的了解而产生的。这是一种现象，即那些对特定主题拥有更多知识的人发现很难与那些不太熟悉的人建立联系。这可能会导致误解、沟通不畅甚至冲突。

The concept goes back to a [1989 economics paper](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/sds/docs/loewenstein/CurseknowledgeEconSet.pdf) by Colin Camerer, George Loewenstein and Martin Weber. It has since been applied more broadly and I’m sure you’ve experienced it in one way or another. Think of something you’ve learned recently, something as mundane as basic chess moves. Once acquired, your knowledge has cursed you so to speak. The better you get the harder it is to imagine what not knowing basic chess was like.  

这个概念可以追溯到 1989 年 Colin Camerer、George Loewenstein 和 Martin Weber 发表的一篇经济学论文。从那以后，它得到了更广泛的应用，我相信您已经以某种方式体验过它。想想你最近学到的东西，像基本的国际象棋走法这样平凡的东西。一旦获得，可以说你的知识已经诅咒了你。你做得越好，就越难想象不懂基本国际象棋会是什么样子。

This curse can affect any type of relationship, from personal to professional, and can have far-reaching consequences. It’s particularly fateful if it affects those whose job it is to impart their knowledge to others. Imagine a math genius turned school teacher who’s forgotten what it was like not to understand basic algebra. Or a highly capable risk analyst who has a hard time enduring journalists failing basic probability.  

这种诅咒会影响任何类型的关系，从个人关系到职业关系，并可能产生深远的影响。如果它影响到那些以将知识传授给他人为工作的人，那将是特别致命的。想象一下，一个数学天才变成了学校老师，他忘记了不懂基本代数是什么感觉。或者是一位能力很强的风险分析师，他很难忍受记者失败的基本概率。

## Consequences of the Curse of Knowledge  

知识诅咒的后果

The consequences are not far to seek. Those with greater knowledge may be so focused on the details of the topic that they’re unable to explain the basics in a way that is accessible to those with less knowledge. At its core, the Curse of Knowledge is rooted in the inability of the knowledgeable to relate to those with less understanding.  

后果不远了。知识渊博的人可能过于专注于主题的细节，以至于他们无法以知识较少的人可以理解的方式解释基础知识。知识诅咒的核心是知识渊博的人无法与知识匮乏的人建立联系。

Especially masters in their field possess something akin to [unconscious competence](https://themindcollection.com/four-stages-of-competence/). Their expertise has become intuitive. They don’t think anymore. They just do. And it works. The downside of this level of mastery is the inability to teach others to do the same. This renders even the most skilled expert an ineffective teacher. As a result, the more knowledgeable individual may come off as condescending or patronizing, even if that is not their intention.  

尤其是他们领域的大师，拥有一种类似于无意识能力的东西。他们的专业知识已经变得直观。他们不再思考了。他们只是这样做。它有效。这种掌握水平的缺点是无法教别人做同样的事情。这使得即使是最熟练的专家也成为无能的老师。因此，知识渊博的人可能会显得居高临下或居高临下，即使这不是他们的本意。

This can lead to a breakdown in communication, resulting in frustration and confusion. The result is often a lack of trust, as the less knowledgeable party may feel that they’re being spoken down to or not taken seriously. In some cases, the Curse of Knowledge can even lead to resentment or animosity between the parties. The math teacher gets more and more frustrated with her students. The risk analyst lashes out on Twitter.  

这可能会导致沟通中断，导致沮丧和困惑。结果往往是缺乏信任，因为知识较少的一方可能会觉得他们被贬低或没有受到重视。在某些情况下，知识诅咒甚至会导致双方之间的怨恨或敌意。数学老师对她的学生越来越失望。这位风险分析师在推特上猛烈抨击。

You may have experienced the damaging impact of the Curse of Knowledge in the workplace. For example, in a team setting, it can lead to a breakdown in communication and collaboration. This can lead to a lack of progress and inefficient decision-making. Additionally, the fateful curse can cause feelings of alienation among those with less knowledge, leading to feelings of exclusion and low morale.  

您可能在工作场所经历过知识诅咒的破坏性影响。例如，在团队环境中，它可能导致沟通和协作中断。这可能导致缺乏进展和低效的决策。此外，致命的诅咒会导致知识较少的人产生疏远感，从而导致排斥感和士气低落。

## How to Avert the Curse of Knowledge?  

如何避免知识的诅咒？

Sounds gloomy, doesn’t it? The good news is that the Curse of Knowledge is preventable. Those who know more can take steps to make sure that their conversations with others remain clear and accessible. This includes avoiding jargon and being open to answering questions.  

听起来很悲观，不是吗？好消息是知识诅咒是可以预防的。了解更多的人可以采取措施确保他们与他人的对话保持清晰和易于理解。这包括避免使用行话和乐于回答问题。

### Bridging the Gap 缩小差距

Those with greater knowledge can take steps to help bridge the gap to those with less knowledge. This can include offering resources and encouraging the ignorant to ask questions. Avoiding labelling the less knowledgeable _ignorant_ helps, too. Additionally, those with greater knowledge can use their experience to mentor their peers and colleagues and help them develop their understanding. Learning to walk a mile in the shoes of the not-yet-cursed becomes a crucial meta-skill.  

知识较多的人可以采取措施帮助缩小与知识较少的人之间的差距。这可以包括提供资源和鼓励无知的人提问。避免给知识较少的人贴上无知的标签也有帮助。此外，那些知识渊博的人可以利用他们的经验来指导他们的同行和同事，帮助他们加深理解。学会站在尚未被诅咒的人的立场上走一英里成为一项重要的元技能。

In this regard, former CIA covert officer Andrew Bustamante [makes the fascinating distinction](https://youtu.be/T3FC7qIAGZk) between _perception_ and _perspective_ . The idea is to “get out of your own perception and into someone else’s perspective ”. To make a conscious effort to picture what their life is like with all its emotions and problems. This gives us a better chance of knowing where the person we’re trying to impart knowledge to is coming from.  

在这方面，前中央情报局秘密官员安德鲁·布斯塔曼特 (Andrew Bustamante) 对知觉和观点进行了引人入胜的区分。这个想法是“走出你自己的看法，进入别人的观点”。有意识地努力想象他们的生活是什么样的，包括所有的情绪和问题。这使我们有更好的机会知道我们试图向其传授知识的人来自哪里。

### The Feynman Technique 费曼技术

But it’s also how we acquire new knowledge that can play a role in averting the Curse of Knowledge. Richard Feynman is widely considered one of history’s greatest and most influential theoretical physicists. But he was also intellectually humble. He knew how to communicate to laymen in a non-patronising way. One of the keys to his success and attitude seems to have been the so-called Feynman Technique.  

但这也是我们获取新知识的方式，可以在避免知识诅咒方面发挥作用。理查德·费曼 (Richard Feynman) 被广泛认为是历史上最伟大、最具影响力的理论物理学家之一。但他在智力上也很谦虚。他知道如何以一种非居高临下的方式与外行交流。他的成功和态度的关键之一似乎是所谓的费曼技术。

The Feynman Technique is a method that promotes learning through teaching and simplicity. It starts with a blank sheet of paper. As we study a new subject, we write down anything we learn. Next, we attempt to teach what we’ve learned to someone less knowledgeable. The idea is to fill the knowledge gaps our teaching exercise and student questions reveal to us. All while we make further attempts at explaining what we’ve learned in the simplest terms possible.  

费曼技术是一种通过教学和简单来促进学习的方法。它从一张白纸开始。当我们学习一门新学科时，我们会写下我们学到的任何东西。接下来，我们尝试将我们所学的知识传授给知识较少的人。这个想法是为了填补我们的教学练习和学生问题向我们揭示的知识空白。同时我们进一步尝试以尽可能最简单的术语解释我们学到的东西。

Feynman’s way of learning not only prompts us to understand instead of memorise. Relating to layman also becomes part of the process of acquiring new knowledge. It continuously forces us out of our bubble of expertise . To see the world through beginners’ eyes and communicate ideas accordingly . And if you want to take the method to the next level and think even more like a teacher, check out my essay about the [Feynman Technique 2.0](https://themindcollection.com/the-feynman-technique/).  

费曼的学习方式不仅促使我们理解而不是死记硬背。与外行有关也成为获取新知识过程的一部分。它不断迫使我们走出专业知识的泡沫。通过初学者的眼睛看世界并相应地交流想法。如果您想将该方法提升到一个新的水平并更像老师一样思考，请查看我关于 Feynman Technique 2.0 的文章。

## Closing Thoughts

The Curse of Knowledge is an important concept to be aware of, as it can lead to misunderstandings and, in some cases, conflict. Fortunately, it’s a phenomenon that can be avoided by taking the necessary steps to ensure that conversations remain clear and accessible.  

知识诅咒是一个需要注意的重要概念，因为它会导致误解，在某些情况下还会导致冲突。幸运的是，这种现象可以通过采取必要的措施来避免，以确保对话清晰易懂。

It’s possible to bridge the gap between those with greater knowledge and those who know less. This requires a combination of intellectual humility and empathy . Once we’ve mastered this level of approachability, there’s no need to conceal our talent or skill.  

弥合知识多的人和知识少的人之间的差距是有可能的。这需要知识谦逊和同理心的结合。一旦我们掌握了这种平易近人的水平，就没有必要隐藏我们的才能或技能。
