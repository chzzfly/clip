The other weekend I had the opportunity to run a 5k with my daughter (10) – her first such race – near [Seattle Center](https://www.seattlecenter.com/) in downtown Seattle. She first participated in a 1k kids dash without me; then we ran the 5k together.  

另一个周末，我有机会和我的女儿（10 岁）一起跑 5 公里——这是她第一次参加这样的比赛——在西雅图市中心的西雅图中心附近。她第一次参加了没有我参加的 1k 儿童短跑；然后我们一起跑了5k。

That morning she had to get up early. Worse yet, we also switched to [daylight saving time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time) that night. Though excited, she started that morning extra tired.  

那天早上，她不得不早起。更糟糕的是，那天晚上我们还切换到夏令时。虽然很兴奋，但那天早上她开始格外疲倦。

## Struggle

Although she had been going out running in school once a week, this was her first time running the five-kilometer distance. Seattle is a hilly town and accordingly , this course has some elevation changes along the way.  

虽然她每周都会去学校跑步一次，但五公里的距离还是第一次。西雅图是一个多山的小镇，因此，这条路线沿途有一些海拔变化。

She understood to pace herself, but she also found that this was difficult. She noted pains in her feet and she struggled to maintain steady and efficient breathing. Before the end of the first mile, we slowed for a first walking break. It was clearly a challenge, she was very aware of the remaining distance — but she was also determined to finish (and earn pizza at the end).  

她懂得自己调整节奏，但她也发现这很难。她注意到她的脚痛，她努力保持稳定和有效的呼吸。在第一英里结束之前，我们放慢了第一次步行休息。这显然是一个挑战，她非常清楚剩余的距离——但她也下定决心要完成（并在最后赚到披萨）。

We talked, we ran, we jogged and walked.  

我们交谈、跑步、慢跑和散步。

It was great! 太好了！

## Learning

There was an out-and-back portion on the course. Going out, you cannot help but notice the people coming back. Eventually that was us, then soon we were well on our way back, maintaining an easy jog.  

课程中有一个背靠背的部分。走出去，你会情不自禁地注意到回来的人。最终那是我们，然后很快我们就在返回的路上，保持轻松的慢跑。

I noticed a family we knew, who were still going out. They saw us, pointed and cheered. A minute or two later this happened again with other friends, with one of them exclaiming to my daughter “you are looking strong!”  

我注意到我们认识的一个家庭，他们还在外出。他们看到我们，指着我们欢呼。一两分钟后，其他朋友又发生了这种情况，其中一个朋友对我女儿惊呼“你看起来很强壮！”

We slowed to a fast walk. She looked tired.  

我们放慢速度快步走。她看起来很累。

I said, “do you understand what just happened?”  

我说：“你明白刚才发生了什么吗？”

She shook her head. “I am not sure. What do you mean?”  

她摇摇头。 “我不知道。你是什么意思？”

“I know that you are struggling. You are working hard and you _feel_ that you are working hard. You are having a tough time.”  

“我知道你在挣扎。你在努力工作，你觉得自己在努力工作。你过得很艰难。”

She nodded. “Yes …” 她点点头。 “是的 …”

“Well. They couldn’t tell. To them, you looked strong.”  

“出色地。他们说不出来。在他们看来，你看起来很强壮。”

If only you could _feel_ about yourself the way that they _see_ you.  

如果你能像他们看待你的方式那样感受自己就好了。

We kept running, with the occasional walking break.  

我们继续跑步，偶尔走走休息。

At the three mile marker, she pushed herself and almost sprinted through the finish line. She was beaming with pride afterwards and told me later she would want to do this again.  

在三英里处，她竭尽全力几乎冲过了终点线。事后她洋洋得意地笑着，后来告诉我她想再做一次。

It was a win.  这是一场胜利。

After the race, we ended up waiting for the pizza place to open, so that we could place an order. She had half of hers finished, by the time we got back to the car.  

比赛结束后，我们最终等待披萨店开门，以便我们下订单。当我们回到车上时，她已经完成了一半。

## Others

I love telling my daughter about other people (dead or alive), who have accomplished big things, have contributed well. Of course, I especially love telling her about women, who have done so, because my daughter is growing up to be one herself.  

我喜欢告诉我的女儿关于其他人（死了或活着），他们已经完成了大事，做出了很好的贡献。当然，我特别喜欢告诉她有关女性的故事，她们已经这样做了，因为我的女儿正在成长为自己。

Recently I told her about [Candice Burt](https://www.candiceburt.com/), an elite ultra runner, who (as of this writing) has been on a streak of more than 130 consecutive daily runs of at least 50 kilometers. She is documenting this on [social](https://twitter.com/runcandice) [media](https://www.instagram.com/runcandicerun/) and I find it inspiring. Candice is showing us, what is possible in endurance running. I admire her for what she is able to accomplish.  

最近，我告诉她坎迪斯·伯特 (Candice Burt)，一位优秀的超级跑者，她（截至撰写本文时）已连续 130 多次每天至少跑 50 公里。她在社交媒体上记录了这一点，我觉得这很鼓舞人心。坎迪斯向我们展示了耐力跑的无限可能。我很钦佩她能够取得的成就。

Regardless how amazing an athlete is, they are still human. They have good days and bad days. They struggle, often more than they like. Sometimes they feel great, other times they feel very bad. Sometimes they win; sometimes they lose. This may all sound very obvious, but it can also be easy to forget, when you only see someone during the times, when they shine.  

不管运动员多么了不起，他们仍然是人。他们有好日子和坏日子。他们挣扎，往往比他们喜欢的更多。有时他们感觉很好，有时他们感觉很糟糕。有时他们赢了；有时他们会输。这听起来很明显，但也很容易忘记，当你只看到某个人在某个时代闪耀时。

What _we_ see from the outside (and how we interpret that) often tells us very little about how _they_ feel on the inside.  

我们从外面看到的（以及我们如何解释）通常很少告诉我们他们内心的感受。

## Of course

This is only incidentally about running or endurance sports at all.  

这只是顺便说一下跑步或耐力运动。
