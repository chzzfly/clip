this is your regular, cranky reminder that you are never going to get people to give up something that humans inherently do by guilting and shaming them.

这是你经常性的、胡思乱想的提醒，你永远不会让人们通过内疚和羞辱他们来放弃人类天生要做的事情。

no matter how strongly you feel that people ought to feel bad about doing something, and no matter how _correct_ you are about whether or not they should feel bad.

无论你多么强烈地认为人们应该对做某事感到难过，无论你对他们是否应该感到难过的看法多么正确。

shaming someone _is an emotional attack._ and the more vitriolic your attempt at shame is, the more vicious the attack is. most people, by the time they’re adults, recognize this, and have built up various defenses against emotional attacks.

羞辱某人是一种情感攻击。你羞辱的企图越刻薄，攻击就越恶毒。大多数人在成年后都认识到了这一点，并建立了各种防御机制来抵御情绪攻击。

the only people that shame ‘works’ on the way you want it to work are not mentally well. they have moral OCD, or scrupulosity issues, or have been abused so badly that they do not feel like they have the right to have boundaries , or some combination of the three.

唯一以您希望的方式“工作”而感到羞耻的人精神上并不健康。他们有道德强迫症或顾虑重重的问题，或者被虐待得如此严重以至于他们觉得自己没有权利划定界限，或者这三者的某种结合。

most people with healthy boundaries and healthy emotional responses will see your weaponized shame as an attack on them, and will react accordingly . _and they are correct to do so._ because part of having healthy boundaries is not letting random people emotionally attack you, regardless of how correct they are.

大多数拥有健康界限和健康情绪反应的人会将你武器化的羞耻视为对他们的攻击，并会做出相应的反应。他们这样做是正确的。因为拥有健康界限的一部分是不要让随机的人在情感上攻击你，不管他们是多么正确。

you can convince people that you are right and they are wrong. but the harder you try to make them feel ashamed, the _less_ effective you’re going to be. you’re just gonna trigger a bunch of people who are mentally ill and make everyone else pissed at you.

你可以说服人们你是对的，他们是错的。但是你越努力让他们感到羞耻，你的效率就会越低。你只会激怒一群有精神疾病的人，让其他人都生你的气。
