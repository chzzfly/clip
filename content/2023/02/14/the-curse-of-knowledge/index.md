Impenetrable strategy statements can’t unite employees behind an organization’s goals, but concrete language and stories can.  
难以理解的战略声明不能使员工团结在组织的目标后面，但具体的语言和故事可以。

Many sensible strategies fail to drive action because executives formulate them in sweeping, general language. “Achieving customer delight!” “Becoming the most efficient manufacturer!” “Unlocking shareholder value!” One explanation for executives’ love affair with vague strategy statements relates to a phenomenon called the curse of knowledge. Top executives have had years of immersion in the logic and conventions of business, so when they speak abstractly, they are simply summarizing the wealth of concrete data in their heads. But frontline employees, who aren’t privy to the underlying meaning, hear only opaque phrases. As a result, the strategies being touted don’t stick.  
许多明智的战略未能推动行动，因为高管们用笼统的语言制定这些战略。"实现客户满意！""成为最高效的制造商！""释放股东价值！"高管们对模糊的战略声明情有独钟的一种解释与一种叫做知识的诅咒的现象有关。高层管理人员多年来一直沉浸在商业的逻辑和惯例中，所以当他们抽象地说话时，他们只是在总结他们头脑中大量的具体数据。但一线员工由于不了解其中的深层含义，只听到不透明的短语。因此，被吹捧的战略并不牢固。

In 1990, a Stanford University graduate student in psychology named Elizabeth Newton illustrated the curse of knowledge by studying a simple game in which she assigned people to one of two roles: “tapper” or “listener.” Each tapper was asked to pick a well-known song, such as “Happy Birthday,” and tap out the rhythm on a table. The listener’s job was to guess the song.  
1990年，斯坦福大学一位名叫伊丽莎白-牛顿的心理学研究生通过研究一个简单的游戏来说明知识的诅咒，她把人们分配到两个角色中的一个。"拍打者 "或 "倾听者"。每个敲击者被要求挑选一首著名的歌曲，如 "生日快乐"，并在桌子上敲出节奏。听众的工作是猜测这首歌。

Over the course of Newton’s experiment, 120 songs were tapped out. Listeners guessed only three of the songs correctly: a success ratio of 2.5%. But before they guessed, Newton asked the tappers to predict the probability that listeners would guess correctly. They predicted 50%. The tappers got their message across one time in 40, but they thought they would get it across one time in two. Why?  
在牛顿的实验过程中，120首歌曲被挖掘出来。听众只猜对了其中的三首：成功率为2.5%。但在他们猜测之前，牛顿要求敲击者预测听众猜对的概率。他们预测了50%。敲击者在40次中有一次成功地传达了他们的信息，但他们认为他们在两次中会有一次成功。为什么？

When a tapper taps, it is impossible for her to avoid hearing the tune playing along to her taps. Meanwhile, all the listener can hear is a kind of bizarre Morse code. Yet the tappers were flabbergasted by how hard the listeners had to work to pick up the tune.  
当一个敲击者敲击时，她不可能不听到随着她的敲击而播放的曲子。同时，听众能听到的只是一种奇怪的摩尔斯密码。然而，拍手者对听众必须努力才能听懂曲子的程度感到吃惊。

The problem is that once we know something—say, the melody of a song—we find it hard to imagine not knowing it. Our knowledge has “cursed” us. We have difficulty sharing it with others, because we can’t readily re-create their state of mind.  
问题是，一旦我们知道了什么--比如，一首歌的旋律--我们发现很难想象不知道它。我们的知识已经 "诅咒 "了我们。我们很难与他人分享，因为我们不能轻易地重新创造他们的思想状态。

In the business world, managers and employees, marketers and customers, corporate headquarters and the front line, all rely on ongoing communication but suffer from enormous information imbalances, just like the tappers and listeners.  
在商业世界中，经理和员工、营销人员和客户、公司总部和第一线，都依赖于持续的沟通，但却遭受着巨大的信息不平衡，就像攻讦者和倾听者一样。

Leaders can thwart the curse of knowledge by “translating” their strategies into concrete language. Consider Trader Joe’s, a specialty food chain whose mission is “to bring our customers the best food and beverage values and the information to make informed buying decisions.” That’s the company’s abstract umbrella statement, and it hardly serves to distinguish Trader Joe’s from other retailers. But shopping at Trader Joe’s is nothing like shopping at Wal-Mart, and its aisles are full of inexpensive but exotic foodstuffs like Moroccan simmer sauce and red-pepper soup.  
领导者可以通过将他们的战略 "翻译 "成具体的语言来挫败知识的诅咒。考虑一下Trader Joe's，一个专业的食品连锁店，它的使命是 "为我们的顾客带来最好的食品和饮料价值，以及做出明智购买决定的信息"。这是该公司抽象的总括性声明，它很难将Trader Joe's与其他零售商区分开来。但在Trader Joe's购物与在沃尔玛购物完全不同，它的过道上摆满了便宜但有异国情调的食品，如摩洛哥煨肉酱和红辣椒汤。

Trader Joe’s beats the curse of knowledge and pours meaning into its strategy by using concrete language elsewhere. It touts its reputation as the “home of cheap thrills,” describing its target customer as an “unemployed college professor who drives a very, very used Volvo.” The image is a simplification, obviously; at any given moment, there are probably zero of these “target customers” in Trader Joe’s. But because it simplifies a complex reality, the description ensures that all the employees of the organization have a common picture of its customers. Would the professor like the red-pepper soup? Yes.  
Trader Joe's打败了知识的诅咒，并通过在其他地方使用具体的语言为其战略注入了意义。它吹嘘自己是 "廉价刺激之家"，将其目标客户描述为 "开着一辆非常、非常旧的沃尔沃的失业大学教授"。显然，这一形象是一种简化；在任何特定的时刻，乔氏百货的这些 "目标客户 "可能是零。但是，由于它简化了一个复杂的现实，这个描述确保了该组织的所有员工对其客户有一个共同的印象。教授会喜欢红辣椒汤吗？是的。

Stories, too, work particularly well in dodging the curse of knowledge, because they force us to use concrete language. FedEx, for example, uses a story related to its Purple Promise award, which honors employees who uphold FedEx’s guarantee that packages will “absolutely, positively” arrive overnight: In New York, a FedEx delivery truck broke down and the replacement van was running late. The driver initially delivered a few packages on foot; but then, despairing of finishing her route on time, she managed to persuade a competitor’s driver to take her to her last few stops.  
故事在躲避知识的诅咒方面也特别有效，因为它们迫使我们使用具体的语言。例如，联邦快递使用了一个与 "紫色承诺 "奖有关的故事，该奖表彰那些坚持联邦快递 "绝对、肯定 "地保证包裹在一夜之间到达的员工：在纽约，联邦快递的一辆送货车坏了，替换的货车也迟到了。司机最初步行送了几个包裹；但后来，由于对按时完成路线感到绝望，她设法说服了一个竞争对手的司机带她去最后几站。

Stories like this are tangible demonstrations of the company’s strategic aim to be the most reliable shipping company in the world. A top sales executive can use the New York story to say “This is how seriously we take reliability.” A new delivery driver can use the story as a guide to behavior: “My job is not to drive a route and go home at 5 PM; my job is to get packages delivered any way I can.”  
像这样的故事是公司战略目标的具体体现，即成为世界上最可靠的航运公司。一位高级销售主管可以利用纽约的故事说："这就是我们对可靠性的重视程度"。一个新的送货司机可以用这个故事作为行为指南。"我的工作不是开一条路线，然后在下午5点回家；我的工作是以任何方式将包裹送达。"

Concrete language and stories defeat the curse of knowledge and make executives’ strategy statements stickier. As a result, all the members of an organization can share an understanding of the strategies and a language for discussing them.  
具体的语言和故事打败了知识的诅咒，使高管们的战略声明更有说服力。因此，一个组织的所有成员可以分享对战略的理解和讨论战略的语言。
