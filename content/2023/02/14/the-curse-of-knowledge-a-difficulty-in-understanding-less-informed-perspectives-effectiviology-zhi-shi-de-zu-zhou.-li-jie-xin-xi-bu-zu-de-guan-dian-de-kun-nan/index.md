![The Curse of Knowledge](The-Curse-of-Knowledge.jpg)

The _curse of knowledge_ is a [cognitive bias](https://effectiviology.com/cognitive-biases/) that causes people to fail to properly understand the perspective of those who do not have as much information as them.  
知识的诅咒是一种认知偏见，它导致人们无法正确理解那些没有像他们那样拥有大量信息的人的观点。

For example, the curse of knowledge can mean that an expert in some field might struggle to teach beginners, because the expert intuitively assumes that things that are obvious to them are also obvious to the beginners, even though that’s not the case.  
例如，知识的诅咒可能意味着某个领域的专家在教初学者时可能很吃力，因为专家凭直觉认为对他们来说很明显的事情对初学者来说也很明显，尽管事实并非如此。

Because the curse of knowledge can cause issues in various areas of life, such as when it comes to communicating with others, it’s important to understand it. As such, in the following article you will learn more about the curse of knowledge, understand why people experience it, and see how you can account for its influence.  
因为知识的诅咒会在生活的各个领域造成问题，比如在与他人沟通时，了解它是很重要的。因此，在下面的文章中，你将了解更多关于知识的诅咒，理解为什么人们会经历它，并看看你如何能说明它的影响。

The following are examples of common ways in which the curse of knowledge can influence people:  
以下是知识的诅咒能够影响人们的常见方式的例子。

-   **The curse of knowledge can make it harder for experts to teach beginners.** For example, a math professor might find it [difficult](https://doi.org/10.1111/test.12320) to teach first-year math students, because it’s hard for the professor to account for the fact that they know much more about the topic than the students. This aspect of the curse of knowledge, whereby experts [struggle](http://web.archive.org/web/20210520143443/https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200711/backpage.cfm) to teach in a way that beginners can [understand](https://doi.org/10.1109/fie.2008.4720529), is sometimes [referred to](https://doi.org/10.1037/1076-898X.5.2.205) as the _curse of expertise_.  
    知识的诅咒会使专家更难教导初学者。例如，一个数学教授可能发现很难教一年级的数学学生，因为教授很难解释他们比学生更了解这个主题的事实。知识的诅咒的这一方面，即专家努力以初学者能够理解的方式进行教学，有时被称为专业知识的诅咒。
-   **The curse of knowledge can make it harder for people to communicate.** For example, it can be difficult for a scientist to discuss their work with laypeople, because the scientist might [struggle](https://doi.org/10.1109/tvcg.2019.2917689) to remember that those people [aren’t familiar](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acra.2019.03.026) with the terminology in the scientist’s field.  
    知识的魔咒会使人们更难沟通。例如，科学家与普通人讨论他们的工作可能会很困难，因为科学家可能会努力记住那些人不熟悉科学家领域的术语。
-   **The curse of knowledge can make it harder for people to predict the behavior of others.** For example, an experienced driver may be surprised by something dangerous that a new driver does, because the experienced driver struggles to understand that the new driver doesn’t understand the danger of what they’re doing. This aspect of the curse of knowledge is associated with people’s [expectation](http://web.archive.org/web/20210520182500/https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/208043) that those who are less informed than them will use information that the less-informed individuals [don’t actually have](https://doi.org/10.1006/cogp.1994.1006).  
    知识的诅咒会使人们更难预测他人的行为。例如，一个有经验的司机可能会对一个新司机所做的危险事情感到惊讶，因为有经验的司机很难理解新司机并不了解他们所做的事情的危险性。知识的诅咒的这个方面与人们的期望有关，即那些比他们信息少的人将使用信息少的人实际上没有的信息。
-   **The curse of knowledge can make it harder for people to understand their own past behavior****.** For example, it can cause someone to think that they were foolish for making a certain decision in the past, even though the information that they [had at the time](https://doi.org/10.1111%2Fj.1467-9280.2007.01909.x) actually strongly supported that decision. This aspect of the curse of knowledge can [manifest](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2017.04.015) in [various ways](https://www.jstor.org/stable/248305) and be referred to using [various terms](https://doi.org/10.1111/cdev.13437), such as the _hindsight bias_, _knew-it-all along effect_, and _creeping determinism_.  
    知识的诅咒会使人们更难理解他们自己过去的行为。例如，它可能导致某人认为他们过去做出的某个决定是愚蠢的，尽管他们当时掌握的信息实际上强烈支持那个决定。知识的诅咒的这一方面可以以各种方式表现出来，并使用各种术语，如事后诸葛亮式的偏见、知己知彼式的效应和爬行的决定论。

_Note_: when it comes to the curse of knowledge, the perspective of the less-informed individual, whether it’s a different person or one’s past self, is often [referred to](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0244141) as a _naive perspective_.  
注意：当涉及到知识的诅咒时，信息量较少的人的观点，无论是不同的人还是过去的自己，通常被称为天真的观点。

### The tapping study  攻读研究 。

One well-known example of the curse of knowledge is the _tapping study_. In this [study](https://web.archive.org/web/20181215225420/https://creatorsvancouver.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/rocky-road-from-actions-to-intentions.pdf), participants were randomly assigned to be either a _tapper_ or a _listener_. Each _tapper_ finger-tapped three tunes (which were selected from a list of 25 well-known songs) on a desk, and was then asked to estimate the probability that the _listener_ will be able to successfully identify the song that they tapped, based only on the finger tapping.  
知识的诅咒的一个著名例子是攻读研究。在这项研究中，参与者被随机分配为敲击者或听众。每个敲击者在桌子上用手指敲击三首曲子（这些曲子是从25首著名歌曲中选出的），然后被要求估计听众能够成功识别他们所敲击的歌曲的概率，只根据手指的敲击情况。

On average, _tappers_ estimated that listeners will be able to correctly identify the tunes that they tapped in about 50% of cases, with estimates ranging anywhere from 10% to 95%. However, in reality, _listeners_ were able to successfully identify the tune based on the finger tapping in only 2.5% of cases, which is far below even the most pessimistic estimate provided by a tapper, and which therefore represents evidence of the curse of knowledge.  
平均而言，敲击者估计，听众在大约50%的情况下能够正确识别他们敲击的曲子，估计值从10%到95%不等。然而，在现实中，听众仅在2.5%的情况下能够根据手指的敲击成功识别曲子，这甚至远远低于敲击者提供的最悲观的估计，因此这代表了知识的诅咒的证据。

Furthermore, when _tappers_ listened to the _experimenter_ tap out the tunes that they had chosen, they still estimated that around 50% of people would be able to guess the tune that was being tapped by the _experimenter_, since they themselves had an easy time identifying those tunes. This was the case even when those original tappers were replaced by new people, who never served as either a _tapper_ or as a _listener_.  
此外，当敲击者听实验者敲击他们选择的曲子时，他们仍然估计大约50%的人能够猜到实验者正在敲击的曲子，因为他们自己很容易识别这些曲子。即使那些原来的敲击者被新的人取代，也是如此，这些人既没有担任过敲击者，也没有担任过听众。

Overall, the tapping study demonstrates how the curse of knowledge can affect people’s judgment. Specifically, it shows that people who know which tune is being tapped have an easy time identifying it, and therefore struggle to accurately predict the perspective of others, who don’t have the same knowledge that they do.  
总的来说，这项研究显示了知识的诅咒如何影响人们的判断。具体来说，它表明知道哪首曲子被窃听的人很容易识别它，因此很难准确预测其他人的观点，因为他们不具备与他们相同的知识。

_Note:_ the tapping study was published in the [1990 doctoral dissertation](https://web.archive.org/web/20181215225420/https://creatorsvancouver.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/rocky-road-from-actions-to-intentions.pdf) of Stanford student Elizabeth Louise Newton. The dissertation is often referenced using the title “Overconfidence in the Communication of Intent: Heard and Unheard Melodies”. However, the dissertation’s original title [appears](https://web.archive.org/web/20181215225420/https://creatorsvancouver.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/rocky-road-from-actions-to-intentions.pdf) to [have been](https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/508033) “The Rocky Road from Actions to Intentions”, and this discrepancy may have occurred as a result of how the dissertation was referenced by Newton’s supervisor, Professor Lee Ross, in a [1991 book chapter](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60333-0).  
注：攻读研究发表在斯坦福大学学生Elizabeth Louise Newton1990年的博士论文中。这篇论文经常以 "意图交流中的过度自信 "为题被引用。听到的和未听到的旋律"。然而，论文的原标题似乎是 "从行动到意图的坎坷之路"，这种差异可能是由于牛顿的导师李-罗斯教授在1991年的一本书的章节中如何引用了这篇论文的结果。

## The psychology and causes of the curse of knowledge  
知识的诅咒的心理学和原因

The curse of knowledge is [attributed](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2017.04.015) to two main cognitive mechanisms:  
知识的诅咒被归结为两个主要的认知机制。

-   **_Inhibitory control_**, which represents people’s inability to fully ignore information that they have when they try to reason about other perspectives.  
    抑制性控制，代表着人们在试图推理其他观点时，无法完全忽略自己所掌握的信息。
-   **_Fluency misattribution_**, which represents people’s tendency to overestimate the likelihood that information that they know and have processed will also be known and processed by others. This means, for example, that people assume that information that they know is more commonly known by others than is actually the case, or is easier for others to infer or foresee than it really is. This can be attributed to people’s tendency to assume that their _subjective_ fluency when it comes to certain information represents that information’s _objective_ fluency.  
    流利性错误归因，代表人们倾向于高估自己知道和处理过的信息也会被他人知道和处理的可能性。这意味着，例如，人们认为自己知道的信息比实际情况更容易被别人知道，或者别人比实际情况更容易推断或预见。这可以归因于人们倾向于认为他们在涉及某些信息时的主观流畅性代表了该信息的客观流畅性。

People’s curse of knowledge can be [caused](https://doi.org/10.1111/test.12320) by either of these mechanisms, and both mechanisms may [play a role](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2017.04.015) at the same time.  
人们对知识的诅咒可能是由这两种机制中的任何一种造成的，而且这两种机制可能同时发挥作用。

Furthermore, [other cognitive mechanisms](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2017.04.015) may also [lead](https://doi.org/10.1111/test.12320) to the curse of knowledge. For example, [one such mechanism](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2017.04.015) is _anchoring and adjustment_, which in this case means that when people try to reason about a less-informed perspective, their starting point is often their own perspective, which they struggle to adjust from properly.  
此外，其他认知机制也可能导致知识的诅咒。例如，其中一个机制是锚定和调整，在这种情况下，这意味着当人们试图推理一个信息较少的观点时，他们的出发点往往是自己的观点，他们很难从这个角度进行适当调整。

All these mechanisms, in turn, can be attributed to [various causes](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2017.04.015), such as the brain’s focus on acquiring and using information, rather than on inhibiting it, which is beneficial in most cases but problematic in others.  
所有这些机制又可以归因于各种原因 ，如大脑专注于获取和使用信息，而不是抑制信息，这在大多数情况下是有益的，但在其他情况下却有问题。

In addition, various factors, such as [age](https://doi.org/10.1111%2Fj.0963-7214.2005.00328.x) and [cultural background](https://doi.org/10.1163/15685373-12340064), can influence people’s tendency to display the curse of knowledge, as well as the way and degree to which they display it.  
此外，各种因素，如年龄和文化背景，可以影响人们展示知识诅咒的倾向，以及他们展示知识的方式和程度。

Finally, other psychological concepts are associated with the curse of knowledge. The most notable of these [is](https://doi.org/10.1111%2Fj.0963-7214.2005.00328.x) _theory of mind_, which is the ability to [understand](http://web.archive.org/web/20201113164046/https:/dictionary.apa.org/theory-of-mind) that other people have perceptions, thoughts, emotions, beliefs, desires, and intentions that are different from your own, and that these things can influence people’s behavior. Insufficient theory of mind can therefore lead to an increase in the curse of knowledge, and conversely, proper theory of mind can [reduce](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10212-013-0200-7) the curse of knowledge.  
最后，其他心理学概念也与知识的诅咒有关。其中最值得注意的是心智理论，即理解其他人有与自己不同的感知、思想、情感、信念、欲望和意图的能力，而且这些东西会影响人们的行为。因此，不充分的心智理论会导致知识诅咒的增加，反之，适当的心智理论可以减少知识诅咒。

_Note_: the term the “curse of knowledge” was coined in a [1989 paper](https://doi.org/10.1086/261651) by researchers Colin Camerer, George Loewenstein, and Martin Weber. This phenomenon is sometimes also [conceptualized](https://doi.org/10.1037%2F1089-2680.7.1.38) as _epistemic egocentrism_, though some theoretical distinctions may be drawn between these concepts.  
注："知识的诅咒 "一词是由研究人员科林-卡梅勒、乔治-洛温斯坦和马丁-韦伯在1989年的一篇论文中创造的。这种现象有时也被概念化为 "自我中心主义"，尽管这些概念之间可能存在一些理论上的区别。

## How to deal with the curse of knowledge  
如何应对知识的诅咒 。

There are several things that you can do to reduce the curse of knowledge:  
有几件事你可以做，以减少知识的诅咒。

-   **Increase your understanding of the bias and its impact.** Specifically, understand what the curse of knowledge is, why it happens, how it affects people, and when and where it’s likely to affect people in general, and you in particular.  
    增加你对偏见及其影响的了解。具体来说，了解什么是知识的诅咒，为什么会发生，它是如何影响人们的，以及何时何地有可能影响一般人，特别是你。
-   **Maintain awareness of the bias and its impact.** For example, in situations where you’re likely to be influenced by the curse of knowledge, remind yourself that others might not know everything that you do, and that this is important to keep that in mind when considering their perspective.  
    保持对偏见及其影响的认识。例如，在你可能受到知识的诅咒影响的情况下，提醒自己，别人可能不知道你的一切，在考虑他们的观点时，这一点很重要。
-   **Identify the perspectives involved and the differences between them.** For example, you can ask yourself what common knowledge you share with others, and what unique knowledge you have that others don’t.  
    识别所涉及的观点以及它们之间的差异。例如，你可以问自己，你和别人有哪些共同的知识，以及你有哪些别人没有的独特知识。
-   **Clearly identify what knowledge is needed.** For example, if you’re angry at someone for not apologizing after acting in a way that hurt you, even though they might not even know that they hurt you, ask yourself what information they would need to have in order to know that they hurt you, and consider whether they actually have that information.  
    清楚地确定需要什么知识。例如，如果你对某人以伤害你的方式行事后不道歉感到愤怒，尽管他们可能根本不知道他们伤害了你，那么问问自己，为了知道他们伤害了你，他们需要拥有哪些信息，并考虑他们是否真的拥有这些信息。
-   **Get feedback from relevant individuals.** For example, if you’re a [teacher](https://doi.org/10.1111/test.12320), you can [ask students](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-93224-8_5) if they understood what you said, or ask questions that check their understanding. Similarly, if you’re talking to someone about a complex topic for the first time, you can start by asking them what they know, so you can properly gauge their level of understanding.  
    从相关人员那里获得反馈。例如，如果你是一名教师 ，你可以问学生是否理解了你所说的内容，或者提出问题来检查他们的理解。同样，如果你第一次和别人谈论一个复杂的话题，你可以先问他们知道什么，这样你就可以正确衡量他们的理解程度。
-   **When in doubt, assume lack of knowledge.** For example, if you’re a researcher who’s giving a talk to people who aren’t experts in your field, assume from the start that they won’t be familiar with highly technical terms, and make sure to either avoid those terms or explain them explicitly. This can be particularly useful in cases where you can’t get feedback from your audience, such as when the communication is primarily one-sided, so you can’t get much feedback while communicating. Furthermore, to facilitate communication and positive relationships with others, you should not only avoid taking it for granted that people know things if there are any doubts as to whether that is the case, but you should also avoid implying that they know these things. For example, you [shouldn’t](https://doi.org/10.1111/test.12320) say things such as “obviously”, “clearly”, or “of course”, unless you’re absolutely sure that they’re appropriate, and even then it can be better to avoid them.  
    当有疑问时，假设缺乏知识。例如，如果你是一名研究人员，要给那些不是你所在领域专家的人做讲座，那么从一开始就假设他们不会熟悉高度技术性的术语，并确保避免使用这些术语或明确解释这些术语。这在你无法从听众那里得到反馈的情况下会特别有用，比如当交流主要是单方面的，所以你在交流时无法得到很多反馈。此外，为了促进与他人的沟通和积极的关系，如果对人们是否知道的事情有任何怀疑，你不仅应该避免想当然地认为他们知道，而且你还应该避免暗示他们知道这些事情。例如，你不应该说诸如 "很明显"、"很清楚 "或 "当然 "之类的话，除非你绝对确定它们是合适的，即使如此，也最好避免使用。
-   **Use other debiasing techniques.** For example, you can use various [general debiasing techniques](https://effectiviology.com/cognitive-debiasing-how-to-debias/), such as slowing down your reasoning process and improving your decision-making environment. In addition, you can use debiasing techniques that are meant to reduce [egocentric biases](https://effectiviology.com/egocentric-bias/), such as visualizing the perspective of others and then [adjusting your judgment](http://web.archive.org/web/20210520181526/https://cogsci.mindmodeling.org/2018/papers/0304/) based on this, or using [self-distancing language](https://effectiviology.com/self-distancing-rational-decisions/) (e.g., by asking “are _you_ teaching in a way that the students can understand?” instead of “am _I_ teaching in a way that the students can understand?”).  
    使用其他去污技术。例如，你可以使用各种一般的去污技术，如放慢你的推理过程，改善你的决策环境。此外，你还可以使用旨在减少自我中心偏见的去伪存真技巧，如将他人的观点可视化，然后在此基础上调整你的判断，或使用自我扭曲的语言（例如，问 "你是否以学生能理解的方式进行教学？"而不是 "我是否以学生能理解的方式进行教学？"）。

You can also use these techniques to help other people reduce their curse of knowledge in various ways. For example, you teach people directly about the curse of knowledge and about these techniques for reducing it, or you can help them implement these techniques indirectly, for instance by encouraging them to visualize the perspective of others.  
你也可以用这些技巧来帮助其他人以各种方式减少知识的诅咒。例如，你直接向人们传授知识的诅咒和这些减少知识的技巧，或者你可以间接地帮助他们实施这些技巧，例如鼓励他们把别人的观点可视化。

However, keep in mind that none of these techniques are guaranteed to work perfectly in every situation. This means, for example, that some techniques might not work for some individuals in some circumstances, or that even if a certain technique does work, it will only reduce someone’s curse of knowledge to some degree, but won’t eliminate it entirely.  
然而，请记住，这些技巧都不能保证在每种情况下都能完美地发挥作用。这意味着，例如，在某些情况下，一些技巧可能对某些人不起作用，或者即使某种技巧确实有效，它也只能在一定程度上减少某人的知识诅咒，但不会完全消除它。

Finally, note that accounting for the curse of knowledge can be beneficial when it helps you understand and predict people’s behavior, including your own, even in situations where you don’t reduce this bias. For example, understanding the curse of knowledge can help you select instructors more effectively, by realizing that one instructor having more expertise than another could actually make the expert instructor worse at teaching.  
最后，请注意，考虑到知识的诅咒是有益的，它可以帮助你理解和预测人们的行为，包括你自己的行为，即使在你不减少这种偏见的情况下。例如，了解知识的诅咒可以帮助你更有效地选择教员，因为你会意识到一个教员比另一个教员拥有更多的专业知识，这实际上会使专家教员的教学效果更差。

Overall, you can reduce the curse of knowledge in various ways, including increasing your understanding and awareness of this bias, identifying the perspectives involved and the differences between them, getting feedback from relevant individuals, and using general debiasing techniques, such as slowing down the reasoning process. You can also use these techniques to reduce other people’s curse of knowledge, and you can benefit from accounting for this bias even if you don’t reduce it, such as when predicting people’s teaching ability.  
总的来说，你可以通过各种方式减少知识的诅咒，包括增加你对这种偏见的理解和认识，确定所涉及的观点和它们之间的差异，从相关的人那里获得反馈，以及使用一般的去伪存真技巧，如放慢推理过程。你也可以使用这些技巧来减少其他人的知识诅咒，即使你不减少这种偏见，你也可以从核算这种偏见中获益，比如在预测人们的教学能力时。

## Related biases  相关的偏见

The curse of knowledge is [considered to be](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0092406) a [type](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0198616) of _[egocentric bias](https://effectiviology.com/egocentric-bias/)_, since it causes people to rely too heavily on their own point of view when they try to see things from other people’s perspective. However, an important feature of the curse of knowledge, which differentiates it from some other egocentric biases, is that it is [asymmetric](https://doi.org/10.1111%2F1467-9280.03436), in the sense that it [influences](https://doi.org/10.1080%2F17470210903168250) those who attempt to understand a less-informed perspective, but not those who attempt to understand a more-informed perspective.  
知识的诅咒被认为是一种以自我为中心的偏见，因为它导致人们在试图从其他人的角度看问题时，过于依赖自己的观点。然而，知识诅咒的一个重要特征是，它与其他一些以自我为中心的偏见不同，它是不对称的，也就是说，它影响那些试图理解一个信息量较少的观点的人，但不影响那些试图理解一个信息量较大的观点的人。

The curse of knowledge is also [associated](https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.75.2.332) with various other cognitive biases, such as:  
知识的诅咒还与其他各种认知偏见有关，例如。

-   The [_illusion of transparency_](https://effectiviology.com/illusion-of-transparency/), which causes people to overestimate the degree to which their thoughts and emotions are apparent to others.  
    透明度的错觉，导致人们高估自己的思想和情绪对他人的明显程度。
-   The [_empathy gap_](https://effectiviology.com/empathy-gap/), which causes people to struggle to understand mental states that are different from their present state, or to struggle to consider how such states affect people’s judgment and decision-making.  
    同理心差距，导致人们难以理解与他们目前状态不同的心理状态，或难以考虑这种状态如何影响人们的判断和决策。
-   The [_false consensus effect_](https://effectiviology.com/false-consensus/), which causes people to overestimate the degree to which their beliefs, values, characteristics, and behaviors are shared by others.  
    虚假共识效应，导致人们高估自己的信仰、价值观、特征和行为与他人的相同程度。

## Summary and conclusions  总结和结论

-   The _curse of knowledge_ is a cognitive bias that causes people to fail to properly understand the perspective of those who do not have as much information as them.  
    知识的诅咒是一种认知偏见，它导致人们无法正确理解那些没有像他们那样拥有大量信息的人的观点。
-   For example, the curse of knowledge can mean that an expert in some field might struggle to teach beginners, because the expert intuitively assumes that things that are obvious to them are also obvious to the beginners, even though that’s not the case.  
    例如，知识的诅咒可能意味着某个领域的专家在教初学者时可能很吃力，因为专家凭直觉认为对他们来说很明显的事情对初学者来说也很明显，尽管事实并非如此。
-   In addition to making it difficult for some experts to teach beginners, the curse of knowledge can negatively influence people in other ways, such as by making it harder for them to communicate effectively, predict other people’s behavior, and understand their own past behavior.  
    除了使一些专家难以教导初学者之外，知识的诅咒还会在其他方面对人们产生负面影响，例如使他们更难有效地沟通，预测其他人的行为，以及了解自己过去的行为。
-   You can reduce the curse of knowledge in various ways, including increasing your understanding and awareness of this bias, identifying the perspectives involved and the differences between them, getting feedback from relevant individuals, and using general debiasing techniques, such as slowing down the reasoning process.  
    你可以通过各种方式减少知识的诅咒，包括增加你对这种偏见的理解和认识，确定所涉及的观点和它们之间的差异，从相关人员那里获得反馈，以及使用一般的去伪存真技术，如放慢推理过程。
-   You can also use these techniques to reduce other people’s curse of knowledge, and you can benefit from accounting for this bias even if you don’t reduce it, such as when predicting people’s teaching ability.  
    你也可以用这些技术来减少其他人对知识的诅咒，即使你不减少这种偏见，你也可以从核算这种偏见中获益，比如在预测人们的教学能力时。
