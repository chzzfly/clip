I remember in earlier days of Tesla, Elon Musk was not really great at his presentation skills. Looking at him I was like I might just be able to pull off my presentations like him. Kinda helped with my confidence.  
我记得在特斯拉的早期，Elon Musk 的演讲技巧并不是很好。看着他，我觉得我也许可以像他一样完成我的演讲。有点帮助我建立信心。

People really don't care. They might chuckle for a moment if you really goofed up but they forget very fast. It's us who amplify what others might be thinking. Someone said it rightly:  
人们真的不在乎。如果你真的搞砸了，他们可能会轻笑片刻，但他们很快就会忘记。是我们放大了别人的想法。有人说的很对：

We suffer more in imagination than in reality.  
我们在想象中比在现实中遭受更多的痛苦。
