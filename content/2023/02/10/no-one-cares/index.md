The transition from childhood to adult life is hard.  
从童年到成人生活的过渡是艰难的。

Our parents give us attention all our adolescent years. But as soon as we cross an age limit and step into the outside world, a brick of reality hits our heads.  
我们的父母在我们整个青春期都给予我们关注。但是一旦我们越过年龄限制，踏入外面的世界，现实的砖头就会砸到我们的头上。

It's written on the brick in big-bold letters, **"NO ONE CARES."**  
砖头上用大字写着："没人在乎"。

No one cares who you are, what you know, and what you have created. People are busy in their own lives. They are lost in their own world.  
没有人关心你是谁，你知道什么，你创造了什么。人们在自己的生活中忙碌。他们迷失在自己的世界里。

You've released the world's dopest music album? No one cares.  
你已经发布了世界上最流行的音乐专辑？没人在乎。

You've spent two years writing a novel? No one cares.  
你花了两年时间写一本小说？没有人关心。

You've made a fantastic app that solves a big problem? No one...  
你做了一个神奇的应用程序，解决了一个大问题？没有人...

That's exactly where marketing comes in.  
这正是市场营销的作用所在。

Marketing is the humble act of accepting that people out there are not your mother or father. They won't give you attention. It is your duty to market your product. It is your duty to make people care.  
营销是接受外面的人不是你的母亲或父亲的谦卑行为。他们不会给予你关注。你的责任是推销你的产品。你的责任是让人们关心你。
