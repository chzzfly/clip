For the last few years, I have been looking for ways to get to know myself better. An unexpected life event in 2019, followed swiftly by trying to maintain my freelance career while solo parenting through a pandemic, left me feeling I had lost my sense of self. Back on my feet, but, like many parents, still trying to maintain the balance of work and home life, I have been searching for a way to support my current reflective practices.  

在过去的几年里，我一直在寻找更好地了解自己的方法。 2019 年发生了一件意想不到的生活事件，紧接着我试图维持我的自由职业生涯，同时独自抚养孩子度过了一场大流行病，这让我觉得自己已经失去了自我意识。重新站起来，但像许多父母一样，我仍在努力保持工作和家庭生活的平衡，我一直在寻找一种方法来支持我目前的反思实践。

Expensive and time-consuming options are off the table, so it has been refreshing to learn about a free method for boosting self-awareness: proprioceptive writing. This process combines meditation and writing, two of the most effective ways to tap into the inner self.  

昂贵且耗时的选择不在考虑之列，因此了解一种提高自我意识的免费方法令人耳目一新：本体感受写作。这个过程结合了冥想和写作，这是挖掘内在自我的两种最有效的方式。

## Rediscovering your sense of self  

重新发现你的自我意识

Proprioceptive writing was first [invented](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/authors/2003117/linda-trichter-metcalf-phd/) in the mid-1970s by author Linda Trichter Metcalf. Metcalf was working as a professor at Pratt Institute and began researching methods to help students find their writing voice. She [developed](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/113642/writing-the-mind-alive-by-linda-trichter-metcalf-phd-and-tobin-simon-phd/) the proprioceptive writing method as a tool to bring the self into focus and clarify one’s own life.  

本体感受书写最早是在 20 世纪 70 年代中期由作家琳达·特里希特·梅特卡夫 (Linda Trichter Metcalf) 发明的。梅特卡夫在普拉特学院担任教授，并开始研究帮助学生找到写作风格的方法。她开发了本体感受写作方法，作为一种工具，可以让自我成为焦点并阐明自己的生活。

The word proprioception comes from the Latin _proprius_, meaning “one’s own”. In medical terminology, proprioception is the sense that tells us about the location or movement of our bodies.  

本体感受这个词来自拉丁语 proprius，意思是“自己的”。在医学术语中，本体感觉是告诉我们身体位置或运动的感觉。

If healthy proprioception is present, you will know whether someone has moved your finger upwards or downwards even when your eyes are closed. Conditions such as diabetes can disrupt this sense, making it difficult to perceive where your digits, or even limbs, are in space.  

如果存在健康的本体感觉，即使您闭上眼睛，您也会知道有人向上或向下移动了您的手指。糖尿病等疾病会破坏这种感觉，使您难以感知您的手指甚至四肢在空间中的位置。

The same is true of our emotions and imagination. It is easy to lose sense of where we are in our lives right now, and the metaphorical direction we are heading in. With emotional proprioception missing, we start to feel lost or as if we are simply coasting along.  

我们的情感和想象力也是如此。我们很容易忘记我们现在在生活中所处的位置，以及我们前进的隐喻方向。随着情感本体感觉的缺失，我们开始感到迷茫，或者好像我们只是在滑行。

If we have ignored our inner voice for some time by not completing any reflective practice, we can become switched off to our own feelings and ideas. Curiosity dwindles, and we may not register our everyday thoughts.  

如果我们在一段时间内没有完成任何反思练习而忽视了内心的声音，我们就会对自己的感受和想法产生兴趣。好奇心减弱了，我们可能不会记录我们的日常想法。

Proprioceptive writing can help us to rediscover our dreams and creative energy, while rebuilding our self-trust. Furthermore, it may help us to resolve emotional conflict while dissolving inhibitions.  

本体感受写作可以帮助我们重新发现我们的梦想和创造力，同时重建我们的自信心。此外，它可以帮助我们在消除压抑的同时解决情绪冲突。

## The benefits of embodied self-reflection  

具身自我反省的好处

In their book, _Writing the Mind Alive_, Linda Trichter Metcalf and Tobin Simon [describe](https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&lr=&id=ibr5kbQknx8C&oi=fnd&pg=PR11&ots=wjki57hXRB&sig=GRFMjhKXlmHD50c3Lkh2Kdk6sxs#v=onepage&q&f=false) the ritual of proprioceptive writing as “utter simplicity”.  

琳达·特里希特·梅特卡夫 (Linda Trichter Metcalf) 和托宾·西蒙 (Tobin Simon) 在他们的著作《活写思维》中将本体感受写作的仪式描述为“极其简单”。

The writing task only takes around 25 minutes. During this time, one listens to inner thoughts, writing down whatever is heard. This could include feelings, emotions or worries that come to mind. These are explored through a combination of writing and inner hearing.  

写作任务只需要大约 25 分钟。在这段时间里，一个人倾听内心的想法，把听到的写下来。这可能包括想到的感觉、情绪或担忧。这些是通过写作和内心听觉的结合来探索的。

Researchers Jennifer Leigh and Richard Bailey [noted](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17432979.2013.797498?journalCode=tbmd20) that self-focus based purely on the reflection of thoughts can lead to rumination, anxiety and neuroticism. Conversely, they found that embodied reflective practices such as proprioceptive writing reduced the likelihood of unhealthy rumination. Furthermore, this practice was found to be helpful for both personal and professional development.  

研究人员 Jennifer Leigh 和 Richard Bailey 指出，纯粹基于思想反思的自我关注会导致沉思、焦虑和神经质。相反，他们发现本体感受写作等具身反思实践减少了不健康反刍的可能性。此外，这种做法被发现对个人和职业发展都有帮助。

The combination of writing and reflection serves as a method to connect physical sensations with thoughts that an individual might otherwise remain unaware of. By learning to listen to one’s own thoughts in a supportive, empathetic manner, it is possible to develop a stronger connection to our emotions.  

写作和反思的结合是一种将身体感觉与个人可能不会意识到的想法联系起来的方法。通过学习以支持的、同理心的方式倾听自己的想法，可以与我们的情绪建立更牢固的联系。

Writing in the _Journal of Vocational Behavior_, Reinekke Lengelle and colleagues [reported](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Frans-Meijers/publication/262196094_Career_Writing_Creative_expressive_and_reflective_approaches_to_narrative_identity_formation_in_students_in_higher_education/links/59dc9d88458515e9ab4c6cd7/Career-Writing-Creative-expressive-and-reflective-approaches-to-narrative-identity-formation-in-students-in-higher-education.pdf) that proprioceptive writing demonstrated increased vulnerability. Students who completed career questionnaires submitted answers that showed openness and depth of understanding, with richer material than would usually be expected of similar reflective exercises.  

Reinekke Lengelle 及其同事在《职业行为杂志》上撰文称，本体感受书写显示出更高的脆弱性。完成职业问卷调查的学生提交的答案显示出开放性和深刻的理解，比类似的反思性练习通常预期的材料更丰富。

Lengelle concluded that proprioceptive writing increased the development of students’ career identities and narratives. This could, in turn, “enable them to contribute usefully to society in a way that is personally meaningful to them.”  

Lengelle 得出结论，本体感受写作促进了学生职业身份和叙事的发展。反过来，这可以“使他们能够以对他们个人有意义的方式为社会做出有益的贡献。”

By connecting with physical sensations through practising proprioceptive writing, you are likely to experience better internal and external emotional connections. This can lead to greater empathy for both oneself and others, as well as improved confidence levels, providing the right environment for personal and professional growth.  

通过练习本体感受写作来联系身体感觉，您可能会体验到更好的内部和外部情感联系。这可以导致对自己和他人的更大同理心，并提高信心水平，为个人和职业发展提供合适的环境。

## How to practise proprioceptive writing  

如何练习本体感受写作

This self-reflection method involves writing for 25 minutes while listening to music. Professor Metcalf recommends Baroque music to aid creativity. The only equipment required is a pen and pad of plain paper.  

这种自我反省的方法包括边听音乐边写作 25 分钟。梅特卡夫教授推荐巴洛克音乐来帮助创造力。唯一需要的设备是一支笔和一张普通纸。

You should then follow these three steps for each session:  

然后，您应该针对每个会话执行以下三个步骤：

1.  **Write down what you hear.** It takes practice to recognise your thoughts and convert them to words, so take your time writing down each feeling as it comes. It can be helpful to think of your thoughts as voices. Perhaps a voice says, “I still need to enrol in that online course”, while another says, “I can’t take on anything else right now.” In the first stage, write it all down without any judgement.  
    
    写下你听到的。识别您的想法并将其转化为文字需要练习，因此请花点时间写下每一种感觉。将您的想法视为声音可能会有所帮助。也许一个声音说，“我仍然需要注册那个在线课程”，而另一个声音说，“我现在不能承担任何其他事情。”在第一阶段，不带任何判断地全部写下来。
2.  **Hear what you write.** Now that you have written down your thoughts, it will be easier to listen to what your mind is saying. Take time to explore each thought before you move on to another feeling or concern. For example, if you find yourself worrying that your income is lower than you would like, dig deeper into where this thought comes from and what your mind is trying to say. The process will help you listen to the story you are telling yourself.  
    
    听你写的。既然您已经写下了自己的想法，那么聆听您的想法会更容易。在你转向另一种感觉或担忧之前，花点时间探索每个想法。例如，如果您发现自己担心自己的收入低于您的期望，请更深入地挖掘这种想法的来源以及您的想法。该过程将帮助您聆听自己讲述的故事。
3.  **Go deeper for each thought.** With every thought you wrote down, ask yourself: “What do I mean by…?” In the salary example above, you would explore your income worries further to understand whether your concerns are related to financial difficulty, your perceived status, personal expectations, self-image, self-esteem, self-worth or another issue.  
    
    深入了解每个想法。当你写下每一个想法时，问问自己：“我说的……是什么意思？”在上面的薪资示例中，您将进一步探讨您的收入担忧，以了解您的担忧是否与财务困难、您的感知状态、个人期望、自我形象、自尊、自我价值或其他问题有关。

Keep your thinking slow to fully explore every thought in the above three steps, rather than letting your mind race ahead.  

保持你的思维缓慢，以充分探索上述三个步骤中的每一个想法，而不是让你的思维飞速前进。

The, at the end of the 25 minutes, stop writing and and ask yourself four review questions:  

在 25 分钟结束时，停止写作并问自己四个复习问题：

1.  Which thoughts were heard but not written down?  
    
    哪些想法被听到但没有写下来？
2.  How do I feel now?  
    
    我现在感觉如何？
3.  What story am I telling?  
    
    我在讲什么故事？
4.  Do I have any direction for future proprioceptive writing sessions?  
    
    我对未来的本体感受写作课程有什么方向吗？

These review questions should help to clarify the thoughts you have had, as well as providing prompts to help you get started on your next session.  

这些复习问题应有助于澄清您的想法，并提供提示以帮助您开始下一节课。

Proprioceptive writing is a simple technique that combines writing and meditation to support embodied self-reflection. This method of self-reflection can reduce rumination and supports both personal and professional growth.  

本体感受写作是一种简单的技巧，它结合了写作和冥想来支持具体的自我反省。这种自我反省的方法可以减少反省并支持个人和职业发展。

Practising hearing intelligence can be enlightening as it helps you not only discover what is on your mind, but the meaning and significance behind these thoughts, too. By putting your thoughts into words, you can play closer attention to feelings that might otherwise go unnoticed. It’s a way to make time to _really_ listen to your inner self.  

练习听觉智能可以很有启发性，因为它不仅可以帮助您发现您的想法，还可以帮助您发现这些想法背后的意义和重要性。通过将您的想法表达出来，您可以更密切地关注那些可能会被忽视的感受。这是一种抽出时间真正倾听内心自我的方法。
